# Defense-Drill-Android-Application
Final year Mobile application project based on Android 

Now a days due to rampant crimes in the country which have no end in sight, ordinary citizens are being caught up in situations they are not ready for. They are unable to protect themselves and those close to them because they do not have the required skillset to remain calm and act in accordance to avoid getting hurt, robbed, or killed. To counteract that we have developed an app which has courses for beginners as well as advanced users which will provide the user with the skillset to at-least defend themselves in dangerous situations.

At the end, the results that would be acquired are: provided the user with ability to defend themselves and make a citizen not so helpless in dangerous situations anyone. Intermediate users and advanced users could be eligible for a career in mixed martial arts by participating in a tournament to test their ability according to their badge levels.
